            <a class="topic-button" href="#data">Data<span class="tooltip">In Machine Learning, data is vital for training models. It can be numerical, categorical, or time-series from various sources. The quality and quantity of data significantly impact the model’s performance. Data preprocessing, which includes cleaning, normalizing, and feature selection, is a crucial step. Essentially, high-quality data is key to creating accurate models.</span></a>
            <a class="topic-button" href="#algorithms">Algorithms<span class="tooltip">Machine learning algorithms empower computers to predict and identify patterns in data without explicit programming. They categorize into three types: Supervised Learning (using labeled data for predictions), Unsupervised Learning (discovering patterns in unlabeled data), and Reinforcement Learning (learning through interactions with the environment). Notable examples like Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Q-Learning find applications in various fields such as image and speech recognition, recommendation systems, fraud detection, and autonomous vehicles, driving advances in artificial intelligence.</span></a>
            <a class="topic-button" href="testing/testing.html">Testing Data<span class="tooltip">In Machine Learning, algorithms learn from data to make predictions. They create mathematical models based on input data, typically divided into three sets: training, validation, and test. The training set is used to build the model, adjusting its parameters. The validation set helps fine-tune the model's hyperparameters and assess its performance. Finally, the test set evaluates the model's accuracy on unseen data, ensuring its effectiveness in making predictions.</span></a>
            <a class="topic-button" href="#feature_engineering">Feature Engineering<span class="tooltip">Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into features that are suitable for machine learning models. It involves selecting, extracting, and transforming the most relevant features from the available data to build more accurate and efficient machine learning models1. The success of machine learning models heavily depends on the quality of the features used to train them. Feature engineering involves a set of techniques that enable us to create new features by combining or transforming the existing ones. These techniques help to highlight the most important patterns and relationships in the data, which in turn helps the machine learning model to learn from the data more effectively1. Feature engineering can also help in addressing issues such as overfitting, underfitting, and high dimensionality1.</span></a>
            <a class="topic-button" href="#feature_extraction">Feature Extraction<span class="tooltip">Feature extraction is a process of dimensionality reduction by which an initial set of raw data is reduced to more manageable groups for processing1. It is a crucial step in machine learning that involves transforming raw input data into a set of meaningful features that can be used for training models2. The goal is to reduce the dimensionality of the data, remove irrelevant information, and extract relevant patterns and characteristics that can improve the model’s performance2. Feature extraction is useful when you need to reduce the number of resources needed for processing without losing important or relevant information1. It can also reduce the amount of redundant data for a given analysis1. </span></a>
            <a class="topic-button" href="#bias_and_variance">Bias and Variance<span class="tooltip">Bias and variance are two types of errors that can occur in machine learning models. Bias is the error that occurs due to wrong assumptions about the data, such as assuming that the data is linear when it actually follows a complex function1. Variance, on the other hand, is the error that occurs due to high sensitivity to variations in the training data1. In other words, a model with high variance is likely to overfit the training data and perform poorly on new data2.</span></a>
            <a class="topic-button" href="#exploratory_data_analysis">Exploratory Data Analysis<span class="tooltip">Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in machine learning that involves analyzing and exploring data sets to understand their main characteristics, discover patterns, find outliers, and identify relationships between variables1. EDA is usually carried out as a preliminary step before undertaking more formal statistical analyses or modeling</span></a>
