            The word Algorithm means ” A set of finite rules or instructions to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations ”
Or
” A procedure for solving a mathematical problem in a finite number of steps that frequently involves recursive operations”.
            
            Most machine learning uses supervised learning algorithms, which are indicated by the use of labeled data (such as time and weather) that entails both input (x) and output (y) variables. You, as the “teacher,” know the correct answer(s) and supervise the algorithm as it makes predictions based on the training data.        </p>
          <h3>Use of the Algorithms

          </h3>
          <pre>
            Algorithms play a crucial role in various fields and have many applications. Some of the key areas where algorithms are used include:

Computer Science: Algorithms form the basis of computer programming and are used to solve problems ranging from simple sorting and searching to complex tasks such as artificial intelligence and machine learning.
Mathematics: Algorithms are used to solve mathematical problems, such as finding the optimal solution to a system of linear equations or finding the shortest path in a graph.
Operations Research: Algorithms are used to optimize and make decisions in fields such as transportation, logistics, and resource allocation.
Artificial Intelligence: Algorithms are the foundation of artificial intelligence and machine learning, and are used to develop intelligent systems that can perform tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and decision-making.
Data Science: Algorithms are used to analyze, process, and extract insights from large amounts of data in fields such as marketing, finance, and healthcare.
These are just a few examples of the many applications of algorithms. The use of algorithms is continually expanding as new technologies and fields emerge, making it a vital component of modern society.

Algorithms can be simple and complex depending on what you want to achieve.

It can be understood by taking the example of cooking a new recipe. To cook a new recipe, one reads the instructions and steps and executes them one by one, in the given sequence. The result thus obtained is the new dish is cooked perfectly. Every time you use your phone, computer, laptop, or calculator you are using Algorithms. Similarly, algorithms help to do a task in programming to get the expected output.

The Algorithm designed are language-independent, i.e. they are just plain instructions that can be implemented in any language, and yet the output will be the same, as expected.</pre>

            Supervised Machine Learning
Supervised learning is the types of machine learning in which machines are trained using well "labelled" training data, and on basis of that data, machines predict the output. The labelled data means some input data is already tagged with the correct output.

In supervised learning, the training data provided to the machines work as the supervisor that teaches the machines to predict the output correctly. It applies the same concept as a student learns in the supervision of the teacher.

Supervised learning is a process of providing input data as well as correct output data to the machine learning model. The aim of a supervised learning algorithm is to find a mapping function to map the input variable(x) with the output variable(y).

In the real-world, supervised learning can be used for Risk Assessment, Image classification, Fraud Detection, spam filtering, etc.
          </p>
          <h3>How Supervised Learning Works?</h3>
          <p>In supervised learning, models are trained using labelled dataset, where the model learns about each type of data. Once the training process is completed, the model is tested on the basis of test data (a subset of the training set), and then it predicts the output.

            The working of Supervised learning can be easily understood by the below example and diagram:</p>
            <img src="Image/supervised-machine-learning.png" alt="ML">
            <p>Suppose we have a dataset of different types of shapes which includes square, rectangle, triangle, and Polygon. Now the first step is that we need to train the model for each shape.

If the given shape has four sides, and all the sides are equal, then it will be labelled as a Square.
If the given shape has three sides, then it will be labelled as a triangle.
If the given shape has six equal sides then it will be labelled as hexagon.
Now, after training, we test our model using the test set, and the task of the model is to identify the shape.

The machine is already trained on all types of shapes, and when it finds a new shape, it classifies the shape on the bases of a number of sides, and predicts the output.</p>
<h3>Steps Involved in Supervised Learning:</h3>
<p>First Determine the type of training dataset
  Collect/Gather the labelled training data.
  Split the training dataset into training dataset, test dataset, and validation dataset.
  Determine the input features of the training dataset, which should have enough knowledge so that the model can accurately predict the output.
  Determine the suitable algorithm for the model, such as support vector machine, decision tree, etc.
  Execute the algorithm on the training dataset. Sometimes we need validation sets as the control parameters, which are the subset of training datasets.
  Evaluate the accuracy of the model by providing the test set. If the model predicts the correct output, which means our model is accurate.</p>

        <article>
          <p>
            In the previous topic, we learned supervised machine learning in which models are trained using labeled data under the supervision of training data. But there may be many cases in which we do not have labeled data and need to find the hidden patterns from the given dataset. So, to solve such types of cases in machine learning, we need unsupervised learning techniques.
          </p>
          <h2>What is Unsupervised Learning?</h2>
            <p>As the name suggests, unsupervised learning is a machine learning technique in which models are not supervised using training dataset. Instead, models itself find the hidden patterns and insights from the given data. It can be compared to learning which takes place in the human brain while learning new things. It can be defined as:</p>
            <h1>Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning in which models are trained using unlabeled dataset and are allowed to act on that data without any supervision.</h1>
            <p>Unsupervised learning cannot be directly applied to a regression or classification problem because unlike supervised learning, we have the input data but no corresponding output data. The goal of unsupervised learning is to find the underlying structure of dataset, group that data according to similarities, and represent that dataset in a compressed format.</p>
            <h2>Why use Unsupervised Learning?</h2>
            <p>Below are some main reasons which describe the importance of Unsupervised Learning:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Unsupervised learning is helpful for finding useful insights from the data.
              </li>
              <li>Unsupervised learning is much similar as a human learns to think by their own experiences, which makes it closer to the real AI.
              </li>
              <li>Unsupervised learning works on unlabeled and uncategorized data which make unsupervised learning more important.
              </li>
              <li>In real-world, we do not always have input data with the corresponding output so to solve such cases, we need unsupervised learning.

            Clustering or cluster analysis is a machine learning technique, which groups the unlabelled dataset. It can be defined as 
            <h4>"A way of grouping the data points into different clusters, consisting of similar data points. The objects with the possible similarities remain in a group that has less or no similarities with another group."</h4>
          </p>
          <p>It does it by finding some similar patterns in the unlabelled dataset such as shape, size, color, behavior, etc., and divides them as per the presence and absence of those similar patterns.</p>
          <p>It is an unsupervised learning method, hence no supervision is provided to the algorithm, and it deals with the unlabeled dataset.</p>
          <p>After applying this clustering technique, each cluster or group is provided with a cluster-ID. ML system can use this id to simplify the processing of large and complex datasets.</p>
          <p>The clustering technique is commonly used for statistical data analysis.</p>
